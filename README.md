## 📥 How to Download (For Beginners)

If this is your first time downloading code from GitHub, don't worry! We use a method called **"cloning"**, which simply means making a copy of the code on your own computer so you can work on it.

### Prerequisites
1.  **Git**: You need Git installed to download the code. 
    * Check if you have Git Installed:  Terminal -> New Terminal -> Type "git". 
        * If no errors it's there!
    * [Download Git here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2.  **Python**: Make sure you have Python installed to run the code. 
    * Check if you have Python installed: Terminal -> New Termainal -> Type "python" 
        * If you dont get errors, it's there!
    * [Download Python here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step-by-Step Download Guide

1.  **Copy the Link**:
    *   Look for the green **Code** button at the top of THIS GitHub page.
    *   Click it and copy the HTTPS URL (it looks like `https://github.com/.../turtle-learning.git`).

2.  **Open VS Code**.

3.  **Open the Command Palette**:
    *   **Mac**: Press `Command + Shift + P`.
    *   **Windows**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + P`.

4.  **Start Cloning**:
    *   Type `Git: Clone` and press Enter.
    *   Paste the URL you copied in Step 1 and press Enter.

5.  **Save and Open**:
    *   Select a folder on your computer where you want to save the project.
        * Note: This will create a folder called turtle-learning" on your computer with all the files. 
    *   When a popup asks "Would you like to open the cloned repository?", click **Open**.

🚧 **Heads up** You may get a popup asking to open a new workspace or add. Choose New Workspace.  

🎉 **Success!** You are now ready to start coding.

### Challenge 1: 🐢 The Turtle Maze
> **Goal:** Program a turtle to navigate through different maze levels without hitting the walls.

1.  **How to Start**:
    Open the file `maze_level_1.py` in VS Code. It's already set up for you:

    ```python
    from maze_challenge.maze_engine import move, player, setup_maze, screen

    # Setup Level 1 (Levels 1-5 available)
    setup_maze(level=1)

    # Write your code to move the turtle!
    move(100)

    # Keep the window open
    screen.mainloop()
    ```
